# What is this project for

It's a lerning process of the book "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney. All the programs are coded with Jupyter Notebook.  For all the datasets you find not executable, go to the book's GitHub repo to fetch it! You may encounter problems when executing paths such as reading a file which is an error of the path and it will be addressed by simply correcting the path.



__There's one thing needed to be noted:__ all `.ipynb` files contains several blocks of `markdown`, which are briefly taken down as outlines for the common used functions (from my perspective). For chapters at the first a few chapters of the book, the `markdown`s are quite not a lot in response to the relative easiness of the content. But as the content goes deeper and deeper and more and more convoluted, it's increasingly necessary to take some notes. __As a result, I strongly encourage you to read from the last chaper to the first one.__

# Reference

All the dataset and code are from the book "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney, whose GitHub link is [here](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book). 

___I really learned a lot through finishing the book. For people who are fond of Python, there's nothing more excellent than finishing the book with executing all the codes on your own, just like what I did. Thank Wes McKinney and his remarkable book exceedingly!___
